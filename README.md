# genetic-nn-tutorial
Basic tutorial for training feed-forward neural networks with genetic algorithms

This code uses a genetic algorithm to train a feed forward neural network to learn to approximate the cosine function.

The only dependencies are Numpy and Matplotlib.

Note that this is written and published only with education purposes in mind, real-world training of neural networks is generally much more efficient with backpropagation.

Genetic algorithms are worth understanding because, while being time-consuming, they make no requirements for end-to-end differentiability and are easy to code.

## Typical output
(Will vary, the process is highly dependant on random initial conditions):
